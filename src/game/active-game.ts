// Explicit "active game" binding — the SSOT for "which game is the user
// currently working on" within a workspace.
//
// Why this exists (root-fix 2026-05-29): the active game used to be derived
// purely from `detectActiveSlug()` — most-recently-mtime'd .forgeax/games/<slug>/
// dir. That heuristic is fragile: any `touch`, scaffold copy, or stray write
// reorders it, so the agent CLI's working directory + the system-prompt scope
// could silently point at the wrong game. Worse, nothing ever *recorded* the
// user's explicit choice (create a game / pick a game in the switcher), so a
// session's cli stayed glued to whatever game happened to be newest at boot.
//
// This module persists the user's explicit selection at
//   <projectRoot>/.forgeax/active-game.json  → { version: 1, slug }
// `getActiveGame()` returns that slug when it still resolves to a real game
// dir, and only falls back to the mtime heuristic when no explicit binding
// exists (fresh workspace / pre-existing installs). Consumers (claude-code
// provider, /api/workbench endpoints, session defaultDir bootstrap) read this
// single function so they cannot drift.
